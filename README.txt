                    SERPENT in C

                    
[ intro

If you're searching for a highly optimized implementation of SERPENT, the 
source code included here probably isn't suitable. It was written to 
reduce space which isn't normally what people want for encryption. 

The initial code was based on work by Daniel Otte (daniel.otte@rub.de)
I've merely rewritten it for smaller code.

The code is public domain, feel free to do with as you wish.
